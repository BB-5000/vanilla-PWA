# vanilla-PWA
This is a plain vanilla Progressive Web App.
It can serve as a Hello World basis to create a PWA.
In order to keep focus on the subject of PWA's it does not distract by featuring the mecancis of react.js, redux etc.
You may add these tools at your discretion.
Have fun with it, as that is how it should be.
